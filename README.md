## Project Overview

Welcome to the AI Bot Integration Project! This project involves developing a solution using Python and a generative AI model of your choice. The key requirement is the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure the AI bot provides accurate and reliable responses. It is crucial that the AI bot avoids hallucinating answers.
